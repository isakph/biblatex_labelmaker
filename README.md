# biblatex_labelmaker
Takes a .bib-file and replaces labels with nameyear (lowercase).
The idea is that this is easier to use than something like EndNote's default, which is to use the EndNote ID as the label.

Run the program from the command line with the filename as an argument, e.g.
`$ python3 labelmaker.py test.txt`
